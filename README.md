# Claude Code Chat History Viewer
The Claude Code Chat History Viewer is a lightweight desktop application that allows developers to browse, search, and manage their Claude Code conversation history. Built with Tauri and Svelte 5, it provides a fast, native experience for reviewing past AI interactions across multiple projects.
The application solves the problem of lost context and knowledge buried in terminal sessions. Developers frequently have valuable conversations with Claude Code—debugging sessions, architecture discussions, code explanations—that are difficult to retrieve later. This tool makes that knowledge searchable, browsable, and reusable.
